# Introducing: Caduceo üè•

## About the Project üìä

**Caduceo** is a comprehensive healthcare cost estimator and data analysis platform designed to bring transparency and efficiency to the healthcare industry. Built using Streamlit, Caduceo integrates seamlessly with MongoDB and Snowflake to provide real-time data on medical procedure costs, insurance rates, and hospital ratings. The platform offers a user-friendly interface with features such as a cost estimator, an intelligent chatbot powered by LLaMA for personalized assistance, and a MongoDB data viewer for in-depth analysis.

## Inspiration üí°

The inspiration for Caduceo came from the need for greater transparency in healthcare costs. Patients often face difficulties in understanding and comparing the costs of medical procedures, which can lead to unexpected expenses and financial stress. By providing a tool that offers clear and accurate cost information, we aim to empower patients, healthcare providers, and insurers to make informed decisions and improve the overall healthcare experience.

## How We Built Caduceo üõ†Ô∏è

Caduceo was built using the following technologies and steps:

1. **Streamlit**: We used Streamlit to create the web application, providing a clean and interactive interface for users.
2. **MongoDB**: We connected to MongoDB using the `pymongo` library to fetch data from various collections, such as `apccosts`, `ccr`, `cptcosts`, `hospitalcost`, and `hospitalratings`.
3. **Snowflake**: We integrated Snowflake to fetch median rates and unique payers for healthcare procedures.
4. **LLaMA**: We implemented a chatbot powered by LLaMA to provide personalized assistance and enhance user interaction.
5. **OCR Parsing with Computer Vision**: We integrated OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text from uploaded images, enhancing the data input process.
6. **Data Formatting**: We applied formatting functions to ensure that monetary values are displayed with commas, while other data types, such as codes, remain unaltered.

## Challenges We Faced üöß

Building Caduceo was not without its challenges. Some of the key challenges we faced include:

- **Data Integration**: Integrating data from multiple sources (MongoDB and Snowflake) and ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Implementing efficient data fetching mechanisms to provide real-time information without compromising performance.
- **Chatbot Integration**: Integrating the LLaMA chatbot and handling streaming responses to provide a seamless user experience.
- **OCR Parsing**: Implementing OCR technology to accurately extract text from images and integrate it into the platform.
- **Data Formatting**: Ensuring that monetary values are formatted correctly while maintaining the integrity of other data types, such as codes.

## Accomplishments that We're Proud Of üèÜ
